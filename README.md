# Portfolio
Hello! My name is Iulian, I am a 15-year-old high school student and I have prepared this portfolio to show you what I have accomplished and what I am capable of doing. I would like to see where my knowledge can take me. I have tried Blender, C++, C#, Unity, and Unreal Engine between the ages of 13 and 15, and during this time, I have decided what I want to do with my future. I want to pursue web development.
